  A behavior for a Probe.

  Modules that define probes are expected to implement all of the functions in
  this behaviour.

  A probe is created via the call to `Instruments.Probe.probe_init/3`, and is
  then called every `sample_interval` milliseconds via the
  `Instruments.Probe.probe_sample/1` function. The probe can then update its
  internal state and do any processing it requires.

  Every `report_interval` milliseconds, the probe is expected to emit its metric
  value.
